# Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x

## Background

### Database columns in version 4.x and older

Versions 4.x and older stored the OTP secret in an attribute called `encrypted_otp_secret` using the [attr_encrypted](https://github.com/attr-encrypted/attr_encrypted) gem. This gem is currently unmaintained which is part of the motivation for moving to Rails encrypted attributes. This attribute was backed by three database columns:

```
encrypted_otp_secret
encrypted_otp_secret_iv
encrypted_otp_secret_salt
```

Two other columns were also created:

```
consumed_timestep
otp_required_for_login
```

A fresh install of 4.x would create all five of the database columns above.

### Database columns in version 5.x and later

Versions 5+ of this gem uses a single [Rails 7+ encrypted attribute](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html) named `otp_secret`to store the OTP secret in the database table (usually `users` but will be whatever model you picked).

A fresh install of 5+ will add the following columns to your `users` table:

```bash
otp_secret # this replaces encrypted_otp_secret, encrypted_otp_secret_iv, encrypted_otp_secret_salt
consumed_timestep
otp_required_for_login
```

### Upgrading from 4.x to 5.x


We have attempted to make the upgrade as painless as possible but unfortunately because of the secret storage change, it cannot be as simple as `bundle update devise-two-factor` :heart:

#### Assumptions

This guide assumes you are upgrading an existing Rails 6 app (with `devise` and `devise-two-factor`) to Rails 7.

This gem must be upgraded **as part of a Rails 7 upgrade**. See [the official Rails upgrading guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html) for an overview of upgrading Rails.

#### Phase 1: Upgrading devise-two-factor as part of Rails 7 upgrade

1. Update the version constraint for Rails in your `Gemfile` to your desired version e.g. `gem "rails", "~> 7.0.3"`
1. Run `bundle install` and resolve any issues with dependencies.
1. Update the version constraint for `devise-two-factor` in your `Gemfile` to the the latest version (must be at least 5.x e.g. `~> 5.0`
1. Run `./bin/rails app:update` as per the [Rails upgrade guide](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html) and tweak the output as required for your app.
1. Run `./bin/rails db:migrate` to update your DB based on the changes made by `app:update`
1. Add a new `otp_secret` attribute to your user model
    ```bash
    # TODO: replace 'User' in the migration name with the name of your user model
    ./bin/rails g migration AddOtpSecretToUser otp_secret:string
    ./bin/rails db:migrate
    ```
1. Add a `legacy_otp_secret` method to your user model e.g. `User`.
  * This method is used by the gem to find and decode the OTP secret from the legacy database columns.
  * The implementation shown below works if you set up devise-two-factor with the settings suggested in the [README](./README.md).
  * If you have customised the encryption scheme used to store the OTP secret then you will need to update this method to match.
  * If you are unsure, you should try the method below as is, and if you can still sign in users with OTP enabled then all is well.
    ```ruby
    class User
      # ...

      private

      ##
      # Decrypt and return the `encrypted_otp_secret` attribute which was used in
      # prior versions of devise-two-factor
      # @return [String] The decrypted OTP secret
      def legacy_otp_secret
        return nil unless self[:encrypted_otp_secret]
        return nil unless self.class.otp_secret_encryption_key

        hmac_iterations = 2000 # a default set by the Encryptor gem
        key = self.class.otp_secret_encryption_key
        salt = Base64.decode64(encrypted_otp_secret_salt)
        iv = Base64.decode64(encrypted_otp_secret_iv)

        raw_cipher_text = Base64.decode64(encrypted_otp_secret)
        # The last 16 bytes of the ciphertext are the authentication tag - we use
        # Galois Counter Mode which is an authenticated encryption mode
        cipher_text = raw_cipher_text[0..-17]
        auth_tag =  raw_cipher_text[-16..-1]

        # this alrorithm lifted from
        # https://github.com/attr-encrypted/encryptor/blob/master/lib/encryptor.rb#L54

        # create an OpenSSL object which will decrypt the AES cipher with 256 bit
        # keys in Galois Counter Mode (GCM). See
        # https://ruby.github.io/openssl/OpenSSL/Cipher.html
        cipher = OpenSSL::Cipher.new('aes-256-gcm')

        # tell the cipher we want to decrypt. Symmetric algorithms use a very
        # similar process for encryption and decryption, hence the same object can
        # do both.
        cipher.decrypt

        # Use a Password-Based Key Derivation Function to generate the key actually
        # used for encryptoin from the key we got as input.
        cipher.key = OpenSSL::PKCS5.pbkdf2_hmac_sha1(key, salt, hmac_iterations, cipher.key_len)

        # set the Initialization Vector (IV)
        cipher.iv = iv

        # The tag must be set after calling Cipher#decrypt, Cipher#key= and
        # Cipher#iv=, but before calling Cipher#final. After all decryption is
        # performed, the tag is verified automatically in the call to Cipher#final.
        #
        # If the auth_tag does not verify, then #final will raise OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError
        cipher.auth_tag = auth_tag

        # auth_data must be set after auth_tag has been set when decrypting See
        # http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL/Cipher.html#method-i-auth_data-3D
        # we are not adding any authenticated data but OpenSSL docs say this should
        # still be called.
        cipher.auth_data = ''

        # #update is (somewhat confusingly named) the method which actually
        # performs the decryption on the given chunk of data. Our OTP secret is
        # short so we only need to call it once.
        #
        # It is very important that we call #final because:
        #
        # 1. The authentication tag is checked during the call to #final
        # 2. Block based cipher modes (e.g. CBC) work on fixed size chunks. We need
        #    to call #final to get it to process the last chunk properly. The output
        #    of #final should be appended to the decrypted value. This isn't
        #    required for streaming cipher modes but including it is a best practice
        #    so that your code will continue to function correctly even if you later
        #    change to a block cipher mode.
        cipher.update(cipher_text) + cipher.final
      end
    end
    ```
2. Set up [Rails encrypted secrets](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_encryption.html)
    ```bash
    ./bin/rails db:encryption:init
    # capture the output and put in encrypted credentials via
    ./bin/rails credentials:edit
    ```
3. Complete your Rails 7 upgrade (making whatever other changes are required)

You can now deploy your upgraded application and devise-two-factor should work as before.

This gem will fall back to **reading** the OTP secret from the legacy columns if it cannot find one in the new `otp_secret` column. When you **write** a new OTP secret it will always be written to the new `otp_secret` column.

#### Phase 2: Clean up

This "clean up" phase can happen at the same time as your initial deployment but teams managing existing apps will likely want to do clean-up as separate, later deployments.

1. Create a rake task to copy the OTP secret for each user from the legacy column to the new `otp_secret` column. This prepares the way for us to remove the legacy columns in a later step.
    ```ruby
    # lib/tasks/devise_two_factor_migration.rake

    # Use this as a starting point for your task to migrate your user's OTP secrets.
    namespace :devise_two_factor do
      desc "Copy devise_two_factor OTP secret from old format to new format"
      task copy_otp_secret_to_rails7_encrypted_attr: [:environment] do
        # TODO: change User to your user model
        User.find_each do |user| # find_each finds in batches of 1,000 by default
          otp_secret = user.otp_secret # read from otp_secret column, fall back to legacy columns if new column is empty
          puts "Processing #{user.email}"
          user.update!(otp_secret: otp_secret)
        end
      end
    end
    ```
1. Remove the `#legacy_otp_secret` method from your user model (e.g. `User`) because it is no longer required.
1. Remove the now unused legacy columns from the database. This assumes you have run a rake task as in the previous step to migrate all the legacy stored secrets to the new storage.
    ```bash
    # TODO: replace 'Users' in migration name with the name of your user model
    ./bin/rails g migration RemoveLegacyDeviseTwoFactorSecretsFromUsers
    ```
    which generates
    ```ruby
    class RemoveLegacyDeviseTwoFactorSecretsFromUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[7.0]
      def change
        # TODO: change :users to whatever your users table is

        # WARNING: Only run this when you are confident you have copied the OTP
        # secret for ALL users from `encrypted_otp_secret` to `otp_secret`!
        remove_column :users, :encrypted_otp_secret
        remove_column :users, :encrypted_otp_secret_iv
        remove_column :users, :encrypted_otp_secret_salt
      end
    end
    ```

# Guide to upgrading from 2.x to 3.x

Pull request #76 allows for compatibility with `attr_encrypted` 3.0, which should be used due to a security vulnerability discovered in 2.0.

Pull request #73 allows for compatibility with `attr_encrypted` 2.0. This version changes many of the defaults which must be taken into account to avoid corrupted OTP secrets on your model.

Due to new security practices in `attr_encrypted` an encryption key with insufficient length will cause an error. If you run into this, you may set `insecure_mode: true` in the `attr_encrypted` options.

You should initially add compatibility by specifying the `attr_encrypted` attribute in your model (`User` for these examples) with the old default encryption algorithm before invoking `devise :two_factor_authenticatable`:
```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_encrypted :otp_secret,
    :key       => self.otp_secret_encryption_key,
    :mode      => :per_attribute_iv_and_salt,
    :algorithm => 'aes-256-cbc'

  devise :two_factor_authenticatable,
         :otp_secret_encryption_key => ENV['DEVISE_TWO_FACTOR_ENCRYPTION_KEY']
```

# Guide to upgrading from 1.x to 2.x

Pull request #43 added a new field to protect against "shoulder-surfing" attacks. If upgrading, you'll need to add the `:consumed_timestep` column to your `Users` model.

```ruby
class AddConsumedTimestepToUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    add_column :users, :consumed_timestep, :integer
  end
end
```

All uses of the `valid_otp?` method should be switched to `validate_and_consume_otp!`
